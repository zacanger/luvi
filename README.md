# luvi ‚ù£

--------

```shell
$ cd /path/to/your/project
$ luvi
luvi listening on 4444
```

By default, `luvi` acts as a static server, serving the files in `cwd`.
On launch, `luvi` will open a tab in your default browser pointing to your
defined root (you can pass a `-n` flag to disable this).

Originally forked from [freddie](http://npm.im/freddie).

Why? Because `freddie` did some things that I really liked, but also did a lot of
things that I really don't need, and doesn't do some things that I really do
want.

Why `4444`? Because I'm OCD, and I really like the number 4.

## BREAKING CHANGES

* 0.8.6: `luvi` no longer has a proxying utility. If you need that, please use
  [freddie](http://npm.im/freddie) instead.
* 0.9.13: `src/util` is now `src/lib`.
* 0.9.19: `src/` is now project root (`src/lib` is now `/lib`)
* 0.9.20: `package.json` is fixed so `luvi` works as a module again. Sorry about that!
* 0.9.21: Please `npm rm -g luvi` and then `npm i -g luvi` to upgrade!

--------

## Installation & Usage

```shell
$ npm i -g luvi
$ luvi [server, ...] [options]
```

`luvi` looks inside `cwd` for a `.luvi.json` config file.
If there is no config file, the default static server is launched.

#### [server, ...]

```shell
$ luvi foo bar
foo listening on port 4444
bar listening on port 8888
```

List of named servers to launch. Only names matching the ones in config file
will be launched.

### [options]

Command-line arguments take priority over config files and defaults.

In a path with a `.luvi.json` file, running `luvi` will follow the options in
the file, unless any options are passed; if there are multiple servers in the
`.luvi.json` file, every server's options will be overridden. Project root is
`cwd` by default.

```shell
$ luvi           # launches the default server
$ luvi foo bar   # starts luvi servers `foo` & `bar`
$ luvi -p 1337   # serves from specified port (for < 1024, must be root)
$ luvi -r /path  # serves from the specified directory
$ luvi -n        # doesn't open the browser after start
$ luvi -v        # display's luvi's version
$ luvi -h        # shows a version of this help dialog
```

### .luvi.json

To configure a single server: `{"root":"public","port":9090}`.
The object will be passed directly to `luvi`.

For multiple servers, simply use an array of single-server configs.
Use the `name` option to keep track of servers in logs.

```json
[{
  "name": "drafts",
  "root": "src",
  "port": 1337
}, {
  "name": "testing",
  "root": "build",
  "noOpen": true
}, {
  "name": "todo",
  "root": "doc",
  "port": 6565,
  "notFound": "/var/www/404.html"
}]
```

--------

## API

You can pass an object to `luvi()` for custom settings; otherwise, these
defaults are applied:

```javascript
const luvi = require('luvi')
luvi({
  name : 'luvi'
, root : process.cwd()
, port : 4444
})
```

This is exactly the same as just calling `luvi()`, with no config object.

These defaults are merged with whatever you pass, so if, for example, you only
pass in a custom server name, `luvi` will still run on port 4444 and use `cwd`
as the root to serve.

Multiple servers can be launched from the same script, with different configs,
by calling `luvi()` again with different options.

#### options

* root
  * `root: '/path/to/document/root'`
  * _Str_ Path where your static files are placed. Server only allows access to files in this directory.
    Usually where you'd have `index.html`. Can be absolute or relative.
  * Default : `process.cwd()`
* port
  * `port: 3000`
  * _Int_ Port on which to listen. If specified port is busy, `luvi` will look for a free port.
  * Default : `4444`.
* name
  * `name: 'foo'`
  * _Str_ Server name. Useful for launching multiple servers, and for keeping track in logs.
  * Default : `luvi`.
* onListen
  * `onListen: function(name, port){console.log(name, 'is listening on', port)}`
  * _function(name,port)_ Called when `luvi` starts listening.
  * Default : `console.log()` (as above) and opening the browser.
* notFound
  * `notFound`: `'/path/to/404.html'`
  * _Str_ Path to a custom 404 page.
  * Default : `undefined`.
* noOpen
  * `noOpen: true`
  * _Bool_ Will not open the browser on server start.
  * Default: `undefined`.

## Contributing

Please do, if you'd like! Any issue reports/fixes are welcome, and feature
requests can definitely be discussed.

* Things I'd like to get done at some point:
  * Remove dependency on minimist
  * Maybe remove dependency on serve-static
  * Better unit tests, more code coverage
* Things I'm not considering:
  * Live reload. If you need this, use Browsersync, it's pretty swell.
